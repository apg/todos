# TODOs: A sentinel on Tripods app ported to Go

A few hack weeks ago, I added a simple Web Framework to [sentinel](https://hashicorp.com/sentinel). No, it was never released. But! I now have a need
for a simple little app to demonstrate some other things. This is where
todos comes in. A simple, "real world"-ish app that is useful as a test bed
for other things. It's better than "hello world" and not much more to
maintain.
